Hide Console Cursor in Windows

This simple C++ program demonstrates how to hide and show the console cursor in a Windows environment. Using the SetConsoleCursorInfo function, it toggles the visibility of the console cursor, which can be useful for creating cleaner user interfaces, especially in text-based applications. By calling ShowConsoleCursor(false), the program hides the cursor, and it can be restored later by calling ShowConsoleCursor(true). This solution leverages the Windows API and is intended for applications where cursor visibility needs to be controlled.

Explanation:
ShowConsoleCursor(bool showFlag):

This function uses GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE) to get the handle for standard output (the console).
It then uses GetConsoleCursorInfo to get the current cursor settings.
The cursorInfo.bVisible property is used to set whether the cursor should be visible (true) or hidden (false).
The function then calls SetConsoleCursorInfo to apply the changes.
main():

ShowConsoleCursor(false) is called, which hides the cursor.
system("pause") is called to pause the program and wait for user input (this keeps the console window open until you press a key).
Expected behavior:
When you run this program:

The console cursor should become invisible.
The program will then pause, showing the "Press any key to continue . . ." message, but without the cursor being visible.
